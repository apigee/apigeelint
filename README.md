Static code analysis for Apigee proxy and sharedflow bundles to encourage API developers to use [best practices](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/fundamentals/best-practices-api-proxy-design-and-development) and avoid [anti-patterns](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/antipatterns/intro).

This utility is intended to capture the best practices knowledge from across Apigee including our Global Support Center team, Customer Success, Engineering, and our product team in a tool that will help developers create more scalable, performant, and stable API bundles using the Apigee DSL.

## Status

At this point, we are focused on plugin execution and modelling the various lintable assets including Bundles, Proxies, SharedFlows, Targets, Flows, Steps, and Policies.

Plugins that test these abstractions are being developed concurrently.

Reporters (the means to report out results), Ingesters (bundle loaders) are to be developed with Filesystem being the only supported means of loading a bundle and all reporting now going to console.

## Installation

You can install apigeellint using npm. But, there is a minimum version of `npm` required.

1. First verify the version of npm:
   ```
   npm --version
   ```

   If the version is 8.3.0 or later, then proceed to step 2.
   If the version is less than `8.3.0`, then update:
   ```
   npm install npm@8.3.0 -g
   ```

   Alternatively, you may choose to get the latest npm:
   ```
   npm install npm@latest -g
   ```

2. Then install apigeelint:
   ```
   npm install -g apigeelint
   ```

## Usage

Help
```
apigeelint -h
Usage: apigeelint [options]

Options:
  -V, --version                           output the version number
  -s, --path <path>                       Path of the proxies
  -f, --formatter [value]                 Specify formatters (default: json.js)
  -w, --write [value]                     file path to write results
  -e, --excluded [value]                  The comma separated list of tests to exclude (default: none)
  -x, --externalPluginsDirectory [value]  Relative or full path to an external plugins directory
  --list                                  do not execute, instead list the available plugins and formatters
  --maxWarnings [value]                   Number of warnings to trigger nonzero exit code (default: -1)
  --profile [value]                       Either apigee or apigeex (default: apigee)
  -h, --help                              output usage information
```
Example:
```
apigeelint -s sampleProxy/ -f table.js
```

Where `-s` points to the apiProxy source directory and `-f` is the output formatter desired.

Possible formatters are: "json.js" (the default), "stylish.js", "compact.js", "codeframe.js", "html.js", "table.js", "unix.js", "visualstudio.js", "checkstyle.js", "jslint-xml.js", "junit.js" and "tap.js".

Example Using External Plugins:
```
apigeelint -x ./externalPlugins -e PO007 -s test/fixtures/resources/sampleProxy/24Solver/apiproxy -f table.js
```
Where `-x` points to the directory containing externally developed plugins and `-e` excludes the builtin plugin from executing.
This example uses the "externalPlugins" directory with a plugin for alternate policy naming conventions and effectively overrides the built in naming conventions plugin. The output will include the external plugin identifier  `EX-PO007`.

### Listing plugins
List plugins and formatters, with or without --externalPluginsDirectory.
```
apigeelint --list
apigeelint --list -x ./externalPlugins or apigeelint --list --externalPluginsDirectory ./externalPlugins 
 ```

## Does this tool just lint or does it also check style?

This tool does both traditional linting (looking for problematic patterns) and style checking (enforcement of conventions). You can use it for both.

## Tests

The `test` directory includes scripts to exercise a subset of rules. Overall linting can be tested with:

```
apigeelint -s ./test/fixtures/resources/sampleProxy/24Solver/apiproxy/
```
This sample exhibits many bad practices and as such generates some noisy output.

In a development installation, the equivalent to the command above is:
```
node ./cli.js  -s ./test/fixtures/resources/sampleProxy/24Solver/apiproxy/
```

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes and new features.
In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code.

Run the unit tests like this:

```
npm run test
```


You can also contribute by reporting issues, asking for new features.

## Rules

The list of rules is a work in progress. We expect it to increase over time. As
product features change (new policies, etc), we will change rules as
well.

This is the current list:

| Linter | Status | Code | Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Bundle | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| &nbsp; |:white_check_mark:| BN001 | Bundle folder structure correctness.  | Bundles have a clear structure. This plugin ignores some files, like .DS\_store and any file ending in ~. |
| &nbsp; |:white_check_mark:| BN002 | Extraneous files. | Ensure each folder contains appropriate resources in the bundle. |
| &nbsp; |:white_check_mark:| BN003 | Cache Coherence | A bundle that includes cache reads should include cache writes with the same keys. |
| &nbsp; |:white_medium_square:| BN004 | Unused variables. |  Within a bundle variables created should be used in conditions, resource callouts, or policies. |
| &nbsp; |:white_check_mark:| BN005 | Unattached policies. |  Unattached policies are dead code and should be removed from production bundles. |
| &nbsp; |:white_check_mark:| BN006 | Bundle size - policies. |  Large bundles are a symptom of poor design. A high number of policies is predictive of an oversized bundle. |
| &nbsp; |:white_check_mark:| BN007 | Bundle size - resource callouts. |  Large bundles are a symptom of poor design. A high number of resource callouts is indicative of underutilizing out of the box Apigee policies. |

| &nbsp; |:white_check_mark:| PD003 | Unreachable Route Rules |  RouteRule without a condition should be last. |
| &nbsp; |:white_check_mark:| PD004 | ProxyEndpoint name | ProxyEndpoint name should match basename of filename. |
| &nbsp; |:white_check_mark:| PD005 | VirtualHost | ProxyEndpoint should have one HTTPProxyConnection, and in the case of profile=apigeex, no VirtualHost. |
