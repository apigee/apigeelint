Static code analysis for Apigee proxy and sharedflow bundles to encourage API developers to use [best practices](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/fundamentals/best-practices-api-proxy-design-and-development) and avoid [anti-patterns](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/antipatterns/intro).

This utility is intended to capture the best practices knowledge from across Apigee including our Global Support Center team, Customer Success, Engineering, and our product team in a tool that will help developers create more scalable, performant, and stable API bundles using the Apigee DSL.

## Status

At this point, we are focused on plugin execution and modelling the various lintable assets including Bundles, Proxies, SharedFlows, Targets, Flows, Steps, and Policies.

Plugins that test these abstractions are being developed concurrently.

Reporters (the means to report out results), Ingesters (bundle loaders) are to be developed with Filesystem being the only supported means of loading a bundle and all reporting now going to console.

## Installation

You can install apigeellint using npm. But, there is a minimum version of `npm` required.

1. First verify the version of npm:
   ```
   npm --version
   ```

   If the version is 8.3.0 or later, then proceed to step 2.
   If the version is less than `8.3.0`, then update:
   ```
   npm install npm@8.3.0 -g
   ```

   Alternatively, you may choose to get the latest npm:
   ```
   npm install npm@latest -g
   ```

2. Then install apigeelint:
   ```
   npm install -g apigeelint
   ```

## Basic Usage

Help
```
apigeelint -h
Usage: apigeelint [options]

Options:
  -V, --version                           output the version number
  -s, --path <path>                       Path of the proxies
  -f, --formatter [value]                 Specify formatters (default: json.js)
  -w, --write [value]                     file path to write results
  -e, --excluded [value]                  The comma separated list of tests to exclude (default: none)
  -x, --externalPluginsDirectory [value]  Relative or full path to an external plugins directory
  -q, --quiet                             do not emit the report to stdout. (can use --write option to write to file)
  --list                                  do not execute, instead list the available plugins and formatters
  --maxWarnings [value]                   Number of warnings to trigger nonzero exit code (default: -1)
  --profile [value]                       Either apigee or apigeex (default: apigee)
  --norc                                  do not search for and use the .apigeelintrc file for settings
  --ignoreDirectives                      ignore any directives within XML files that disable warnings
  -h, --help                              output usage information
```
Example:
```
apigeelint -s sampleProxy/apiproxy -f table.js
```

Where `-s` points to the apiProxy source directory and `-f` is the output formatter desired.

Possible formatters are: "json.js" (the default), "stylish.js", "compact.js", "codeframe.js", "codeclimate.js", "html.js", "table.js", "unix.js", "visualstudio.js", "checkstyle.js", "jslint-xml.js", "junit.js" and "tap.js".

## Examples

### Using External Plugins:
```
apigeelint -x ./externalPlugins -s path/to/your/apiproxy -f table.js
```
Where `-x` points to the directory containing externally developed plugins.

You could, for example, create your own plugin for naming conventions, and
exclude the builtin plugin that enforces naming conventions (`PO007`) with the
`-e` option:

```
apigeelint -x ./externalPlugins -e PO007 -s path/to/your/apiproxy -f table.js
```

This would effectively override the built-in naming conventions that apigeelint checks.


### Excluding plugins

You can, of course, exclude plugins without providing a replacement implementation:

```
apigeelint -s path/to/your/apiproxy -f table.js -e PO007,ST003
```

The above would exclude the policy naming convention check (`PO007`), and would
also not check for conditions on an ExtractVariables with a JSONPayload
(`ST003`), if for some reason you wanted to do that.


### Writing output to a file
```
apigeelint -s sampleProxy/apiproxy -f table.js -w existing-outputdir --quiet
```

The `-w` option can point to an existing directory, in which case the output
will be emitted to a file named apigeelint.out in that directory, in whatever
format you specify with `-f`. An existing file by that name will be overwritten. If the
`-w` option is not a directory, it is treated as the name of a file, and output
is written there.

If you do not also specify `--quiet` the report will go to both stdout and to
the specified filesystem destination.

### Selecting a profile

Apigee X/hybrid is very similar to Apigee Edge, but there are differences in the
supported policy types, and some of the supported configuration options. For
example, policies like GraphQL, the AssertCondition, or the Integration policy
step types are available only in X/hybrid.

As a result of these differences, a proxy that is valid in Apigee Edge might not
work in Apigee X, and vice versa.  Apigeelint uses the `--profile` option to
allow the user to configure which target environment is intended: Edge
(`--profile apigee`) or X/hybrid (`--profile apigeex`). The default is `apigee`.

```sh
# lint a proxy that will be used in Apigee X/hybrid
apigeelint -f table.js --profile apigeex -s path/to/your/apiproxy

# lint a proxy that will be used in Apigee Edge
apigeelint -f table.js --profile apigee -s path/to/your/apiproxy
```

As an example, if you lint a proxy that uses the GraphQL policy type, and you
specify the `apigee` profile, the PO028 plugin will issue an error, telling you
that the GraphQL policy is not available in the apigee profile.  If you lint the
same proxy with the `apigeex` profile, apigeelint will not generate an error.

The selection of a profile affects other checks, too. For example, [the Google
Authentication feature](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/security/google-auth/overview)
is available only in X/hybrid.

### Using the .apigeelintrc file

Starting with release v2.53.0, apigeelint will look for an .apigeelintrc file, with
settings that you want apigeelint to always use, unless overridden on the
command line. If you want to avoid this, use the `--norc` option.


If you DO want apigeelint to use an `.apigeelintrc` file, format the file like this:

```
# settings for apigeelint
# Comment lines begin with octothorpe.

## specify a profile
--profile apigeex

## always exclude these plugins
--excluded TD002,TD007

## use this formatter unless overridden
--formatter table.js

```

Each non-blank line should have a single "option" as supported by the command-line interface.

apigeelint will look for an .apigeelintrc file in these locations, in order of precedence:
* the parent directory of the apiproxy or sharedflowbundle directory specified in the "path" argument
* the current working directory where apigeelint is running
* the "home" directory for the current user

apigeelint stops looking for an rc file as soon as it finds one. apigeelint does
not combine rc files from these locations.

These command-line options have no effect when they appear in the rc file:
* --path
* --list
* --version
* --help
* --norc

### Disabling rules within specific files

Starting with release v2.55.5, apigeelint allows you to disable rules for
specific locations in XML files, using a specially formatted comment. The
comment should be like so:

```xml
   <!-- apigeelint disable=RULEID[,RULEID...] -->
```

The comment should appear on the line before the line indicated in the error or
warning message. If the error or warning you wish to disable does not specify a
line number, the comment should appear on the first line beneath the root
element.

Example:

```
<TargetEndpoint name="target-1">
  <!-- apigeelint disable=TD004 -->
  <HTTPTargetConnection>
    <Authentication>
      <GoogleIDToken>
        <Audience>https://audience2.run.app</Audience>
      </GoogleIDToken>
    </Authentication>
    <!-- apigeelint disable=TD007 -->
    <SSLInfo>
      <Enabled>true</Enabled>
      <IgnoreValidationErrors>false</IgnoreValidationErrors>
    </SSLInfo>
    <Properties/>
    <!-- apigeelint disable=TD002 -->
    <URL>https://my-target-server.altostrat.com</URL>
  </HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
```

You can tell apigeelint to ignore these directives with the command-line otion `--ignoreDirectives`.


## Pipeline lint job integration

### GitLab CI/CD

On GitLab CI/CD, on your `.gitlab-ci.yml` you can use codequality report artifact to get
a report supported by GitLab. Once the CI/CD has been completed, a new tab appears in your
Pipeline named "[Code Quality](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/testing/code_quality.html)".
This new tab lets you easily view the information from the apigeelint job, with the associated
severity level and lines affected. A widget with the same information appears during merge requests.

```yml
apigeelint:
  stage: lint
  image: node:12-alpine
  before_script:
    - npm install -g apigeelint
  script:
    - apigeelint -f codeclimate.js > apigeelint-results.json
  artifacts:
    reports:
      codequality:
        - "${CI_PROJECT_DIR}/apigeelint-results.json"
```

## Does this tool just lint or does it also check style?

This tool does both traditional linting (looking for problematic patterns) and
style checking (enforcement of conventions). You can use it for both.

## Tests to validate the installation

The `test` directory includes scripts to exercise a subset of rules. Overall linting can be tested with:

```
apigeelint -s ./test/fixtures/resources/sampleProxy/24Solver/apiproxy/
```
This sample exhibits many bad practices and as such generates numerous errors and warnings in output.

In a development installation, the equivalent to the command above is:
```
node ./cli.js  -s ./test/fixtures/resources/sampleProxy/24Solver/apiproxy/
```

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes and new features.
In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code.

Run the unit tests like this:

```
npm run test
```

or, run the tests just for one plugin, like this:

```
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha --grep "^PO033"
```

You can also contribute by reporting issues, or requesting new features.

## Rules

The list of rules is a work in progress. We expect it to increase over time. As
product features change (new policies, deprecated policies, etc), we will change rules as
well.

This is the current list:

| Linter | Status | Code | Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Bundle | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| &nbsp; |:white_check_mark:| BN001 | Bundle folder structure correctness.  | Bundles have a clear structure. This plugin ignores some files, like .DS\_store and any file ending in ~. |

## Release Notes

### Release v2.31.0

#### Condition checks around policies

In release v2.31.0, the plugins PO001, PO002, PO003, PO004, and PO005 have been
converted to ST006, ST007, ST003, ST004, and ST005, respectively.  These plugins
move from the "Policy" category to the "Step" category because the plugin
analyzes the attachment of the policy in a Step element, rather than the policy
itself. Also these plugins will now generate warnings, rather than errors.

If previously you excluded PO003 via the `--excluded` option, you must now
exclude ST003, and so on.

#### Sharedflows

Starting with release v2.31.0, using apigeelint against Sharedflows will
generate a correct report. Previously the report on a sharedflow was truncated
and omitted some warnings and errors.
